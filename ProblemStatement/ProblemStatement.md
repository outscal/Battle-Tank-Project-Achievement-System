# [Problem Statement] - Achievement System

**Create Achievement System Using observer pattern and implement at least 3 Types of Achievements**

For example -

Achievement Type 1 → Based on Bullets fired. Under this achievement, there will be 3 sub-achievements.

1. Achievement A → 10 Bullets fired
2. Achievement B → 25 Bullets Fired
3. Achievement C → 50 Bullets Fired

Just like this implement total of 3 achievement types and under that implement at least 3 sub-achievements

(Note: You can also pick different achievement types than mentioned above)
