# Achievement System - Problem

### **Pre-Requisites**

1. Tank Movement (WSAD keys)
2. Tank Spawning (3 types of tanks) 
3. The firing of bullets (Space key)
4. Using Navmesh system to create enemy AI
5. Shooting system
6. Damage System
7. Destroying the bullets
8. Destroying enemy tanks
9. Player Die
10. Basic UI 

## **Things to keep in mind after forking the repository**

1. Install Cinemachine package in Unity
2. Understand the code before jumping to the solution
3. Install Async await packagaes from Unity Asset Store
4. Use Navmesh surface from (GameObject > AI > NavMesh Surface)

## **[Problem Statement] - Create Achievement System Using observer pattern and implement at least 3 Types of Achievements**

For example -

Achievement Type 1 → Based on Bullets fired. Under this achievement, there will be 3 sub-achievements.

1. Achievement A → 10 Bullets fired
2. Achievement B → 25 Bullets Fired
3. Achievement C → 50 Bullets Fired

Just like this implement total of 3 achievement types and under that implement at least 3 sub-achievements

(Note: You can also pick different achievement types than mentioned above)
